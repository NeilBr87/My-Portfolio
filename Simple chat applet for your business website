# Please note: At this point I am only experienced enough to *write* this chat applet for your business website. I can't give you instructions on incorporating it onto the site itself, but will update these as I go along. 
# This is designed for a simple automated chat function. If the chat cannot help the user with their simple enquiry, it creates a log of the person's needs for a human to interact with.

# I've used a default example here. Edit it to apply to your business.
